# Graduation-Portfolio

This is my gradutaion portfolio. It contains three projects:

1. Forecast of Electricity Wholesale Price in Victoria, Australia
2. Fast False Selection Rate Variable Selection
3. Recreation of the Police Precinct Boundaries on the Manhattan Island

The code for each project can be found in their own repository. The pdf file in this repository is the formal write-up about all these three projects.
